# C++ Projects
This repository contains a collection of C++ projects I've completed to build and demonstrate my skills in the language. These projects range from beginner-level programs to more structured applications as I continue to learn and grow.

## 📁 Project List

- `age_analysis.cpp` – Uses loops, if-else statements, and functions with value and reference parameters to:
  - Get input for 3 people
  - Determine their generation based on birth year
  - Identify the youngest and oldest
  - Display leap years from birth year to 2025


## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- How to use functions with different types of parameters
- Writing programs that have more than one function
- Using if-else statements to make decisions
- Using loops to repeat things
- Getting input from the user and showing results
- Figuring out leap years using math and conditions

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`), then run:

```bash
g++ project_name.cpp -o program
./program
